	<h1>AEM PHOTOGRAPHY LOGO</h1>
	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>Hello there! I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science Major in Computer Engineering. Photography is a field that I am really interested to explore. Therefore, I decided to 
		create this website for me to practice and use my knowledge in programming as well as to showcase my photographs. I am a newbie photographer who loves to show my creativity through
		my photographs. Most of my photos are sceneries, plants, and some from my adventure trips. Photos are very important since they hold memories that we want to preserve and look back
		in the future. It will remind us of those happy and unforgettable experiences that we encountered in our lives.
